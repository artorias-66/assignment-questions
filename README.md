### Backend Developer Assignment — Front-End Templates (HTML)

---

## 🧩 Overview
This submission contains four solved question files created using the provided front-end templates.

Two templates were used as per assignment rules:
- 🟩 **Template 1:** Trigonometry (Pythagorean Triplet Problems)
- 🟦 **Template 2:** Compound Interest / Interest-based Problems

Each HTML file solves one complete question while maintaining the given layout and CSS.

## 📂 Files Included

### 🟩 Template 1 — Trigonometry (Pythagorean Triplet)

| File Name | Question | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **template1Q1.html** | **Q1:** Find the value of (Sec C + Cot A) in a right-angled triangle where sides are 5 cm, 12 cm, and 13 cm. | Demonstrates trigonometric ratios using the 5-12-13 Pythagorean triplet and calculates (Sec C + Cot A) = 3/2. |
| **template1Q2.html** | **Q2:** Find the value of (Sec C + Cot A) in a right-angled triangle where sides are 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. | Uses the 3-4-5 triplet to find trigonometric values and simplifies (Sec C + Cot A) = 2. |

### 🟦 Template 2 — Compound Interest / Interest-based Problems

| File Name | Question | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **template2Q1.html** | **Q3:** A sum of ₹8000 amounts to ₹13824 in 3 years at compound interest. Find the rate of interest. | Applies A = P (1 + r/100)³ → solves for r = 20%. Includes clear fraction breakdown and black-box layout. |
| **template2Q2.html** | **Q4:** A sum of ₹10,000 amounts to ₹12,100 in 2 years at compound interest. Find the rate of interest. | Uses A = P (1 + r/100)² → simplifies to r = 10% with step-by-step calculation visuals. |

## 🧮 Template Usage Guide
- Template 1 → For Trigonometry / Pythagorean Triplet based problems (linear & arithmetic logic).
- Template 2 → For Compound Interest / exponential growth problems.

✅ All templates retain original CSS and structure — only numerical and textual content was updated.
